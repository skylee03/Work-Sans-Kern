# Work Sans Kern

A version of the [Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) font with traditional kerning.

## Feature

- **Traditional Kerning**: Kerning information is stored in the `kern` table rather than the `GPOS` table, ensuring better compatibility with various applications.

## Generation

The `.ttf` files were regenerated from Work Sans using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/) with the following options enabled:

- Old style `kern`
- Windows-compatible `kern`

The `.ttc` file was generated from the `.ttf` files using [UniteTTC](http://yozvox.web.fc2.com/556E697465545443.html).

## Installation

You can choose to either install individual font weights or the entire font family:

1. **Individual Weights**:

   - Install the desired `.ttf` files by double-clicking them or copying them to your system's font directory.
1. **Entire Font Family**:
   - Install the provided `.ttc` file by double-clicking it or copying it to your system's font directory.
